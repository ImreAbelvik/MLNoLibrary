# MLNoLibrary

This is a project created for fun. 
I created a simple Linear Regresion model without librarys in python using only the formulas as help. 
After having coded withot a librayr i did the same with the Scikit-learn library in python.

In the code with librayr I have split the data so i have traing data and seperate test data. This is somthing I havent don for the NoLibraryCode.
